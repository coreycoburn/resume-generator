    "Winter is coming, we know what's coming with it. We can learn to live with the wildlings, or we can add them to the army of the dead. But if that's not enough, then consider this: if the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men, stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better."
